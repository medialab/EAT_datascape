Bob Rauschenberg and I organized a group of artists to work together with engineers on a series of performances involving new technology. The group included John Cage, Lucinda Childs, \u00d6yvind Fahlstr\u00f6m, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, David Tudor, and Robert Whitman. The first planning meeting of artists and engineers took place in early 1966 in Rauschenberg's studio. During the summer of 1966, more than 30 engineers, most of them from Bell Laboratories, worked in one-to-one collaboration with individual artists, depending on the artist's project and engineer's speciality.

I asked Tinguely, \"What do you need?\" His answer was, \"bicycle wheels.\" We gathered the material from bicycle shops in New Jersey and the garbage dumps on the New Jersey flats.

The machine would do all kinds of wild things and finally destroy itself. A chicken-wire netting would save the audience from a similar fate. But The Museum of Modern Art came into the picture and offered Jean its Sculpture Garden as the site, and the dome to work in.\r\nThe first drawings of the machine show little resemblance to the final result. A meta-matic painting machine was there. It would create a continuously changing painting that would disappear as the paper was rolled up again into a tight roll. A text of dirty words would unfold. A Virgin Mary was to be sawed in half. Parts of the machine would tip over, others would finally collapse as dozens of saws attacked the steel construction. The noise would be terrific.\r\nThe beginning was slow. Jean bought old motors in the bizarre Canal Street shops. A weather balloon and smoke signals (that did not work) were found in a surplus store. He collected steel tubing for the structure and tools to work with. Pulleys were expensive. He wanted old bicycle wheels from junk yards. But no junk yard in the U.S. deals in such trivialities. I stumbled onto a dealer in Plainfield who was clearing out his basement and carried away 35 old rusty wheels. Jean was as excited as a child when we brought the wheels through the empty museum that evening. The dome was unheated, and the temperature was below freezing, but things began to move. \"I want more wheels,\" he said.\r\nThe next day my wife and I raided the Summit dump. This was a gold mine. We loaded the car and parked it behind the fence on 54th Street. A child' s potty and bassinet, the drum from a washing machine, and 25 more baby carriages and bicycle wheels were thrown over the fence. The Saturday-afternoon passers-by raised the inevitable question: \"What' s going on here?\" On the other side of the fence, Jean was laughing.\r\nThe following day the first structure was almost finished. It contained a large meta-matic with the pot, the bassinet, and the drum as percussion elements. A nut beat on the pot, a clamp jumped up and down in the bassinet, and a fan motor attacked the drum. The paper would unfold from a horizontal roll at the top and be guided down on a sheet-metal trough. Here it would be printed on by an elaborate arm that Jean later worked on for two days until it was perfect. At the bottom of the structure, the continuously moving paper would be blown toward the audience by a fan. The machine was taking form.\r\nJean and I made another trip to the dump. This time it was the Newark city dump, which is as much a reflection of the general neighborhood as is the Summit dump. This large dump was Jean's world. He kept finding the oddest objects and formations. Spilled- out paint would make a painting to be exhibited in some fashionable gallery. Someone had left a complete bedroom suite. If he could find a willing girl (which he admitted would be difficult), this would be place where he would like to live. \"I could, you know,\" he said. He would spend his days in the dump as a completely free man. Out of the debris he would build large, involved constructions. Slowly he would convince the bums, living in small shacks on the dump, that what he was making was important. Eventually they would join him and help him build. Of course, art was never to be mentioned, and his constructions would never be anything else but part of the dump. [p.158] It is against the background of the anarchy and chaos of the Newark city dump that I see the growth of his machine.\r\nThe bums did indeed help us, and we walked away with a cable drum, American flags, a rusty oil can, and more baby-carriage wheels, of which for some reason there were plenty. Jean kept saying constantly: \"We can put anything into the machine.\" In the final analysis, this of course was not true. As we were going back with our load, Jean behaved like a tourist seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. To him the landscape was extremely beautiful.\r\nJean was now going at a fantastic rate. But the dome was cold, and he became ill with fever. This did not stop him, however, and he called anxiously for the insides of an old piano and a radio. I was lucky. A piano dealer in the neighborhood of the museum had an old piano. \"Ten dollars if you come and get it.\" For two dollars, Jean brought an old Addressograph machine from the Museum.\r\nOn the piano he mounted about ten arms made up of old bicycle parts. These arms hit the keys of the piano like the players of a player piano. Attached to the piano was another meta-matic, a smaller one with a sponge on the painting arm. The paper came down and was again rolled into a tight roll. L'art \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re. There were two texts that would roll by like the news bulletins on Times Square. One was vertical, and one was horizontal. \"Je fais l'angle droit, tu sais,\" he boasted. Rising above the structure was a 25-foot- high steel tube that would support the weather balloon at the top. An old wooden radio was attached to the side of the piano and was sawed in half by a large handsaw. The whole section with the piano and the second meta-matic had dozens of wheels in it for the various operations.\r\nThe Addressograph machine was transformed into a percussion machine with cans and a big bell. It made a fantastic noise. As the big motor of the machine worked, a lever stuck under the machine would be pulled in, and the machine would fall over. This system was never tried out.\r\nDuring the last days, he made two small carriages powered by their own motors. One had a giant motor and a two-foot Klaxon sitting on two baby-carriage wheels and a small pulley. This was to be placed under the piano and would at a certain moment escape, dragging odd objects behind it. The second moving contraption was a very odd thing. Jean' s idea was that it would move to the side and fall into the pool of the garden. It would commit suicide. The carriage was made up of a cable drum, more wheels, and an oil can. Sticking above it was a rod to which a corner of an American flag was attached. Two nights before the set evening, we tried it out in the museum. It was a strange sight to see this wonderful creation move laboriously in the empty museum halls. As it moved, an arm tapped a march rhythm on the empty can, and the red and white piece of the flag waved back and forth furiously. Stunned spectators looked through the windows on 53rd Street at the weird and beautiful spectacle.\r\nDestruction seemed less and less an element of the machine. The saws were replaced by joints that would break as the metal of which they were made was melted by the heat from overheated resistors. Thus the original steel tubing was sawed through, and these joints were attached to support the structure. Jean seemed happy not to have to worry about the saws, but the joints never became quite a real part of his structure. As the first meta-matic collapsed, it would fall backward. The piano, placed on a frame two feet above ground, would itself fall backward into the fallen meta-matic. The second meta-matic and the support for the balloon would be dragged along in the fall of the piano. Behind the wooden boards, Jean mounted a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher, concealed by wooden boards. As a lever was pulled, the extinguisher would empty itself with a big swoosh. At the same time, the bell on the Addressograph would begin to ring.\r\nNothing was to be touched during the operation of the machine. The various functions and elements were to be started by pre-set time-delay relays. Everything was elaborately wired mechanically and electrically. Even a flame that would burn on the piano was to [p.159] be lighted electrically. All over the structure were smoke flashes and yellow smoke signals which would be started without direct interference. This combination of electrical and mechanical control gave Jean a great freedom to develop his machine.\r\nAn involved gear system would slowly turn the piano on. After a few minutes, a bucket of gasoline would be overturned onto the flame, a burning candle, so that the gasoline would catch fire. Another mechanical arrangement in the first meta-matic turned three beer cans filled with paint onto the paper rolling down toward the audience. On the very top of the first structure was a trough in which gallon-sized boUles would slide down as they were pushed by a lever. When they crashed to the ground, nauseating smells would spread. A child's go-cart would be pushed back and forth in front of the structure. There must have even about a hundred different operations in the machine.\r\nNot until the last days did Jean decide to paint his machine all white. He seemed fascinated with this color but was a little worried that the machine would look too beautiful. The only counterpoint seemed to be the balloon that would explode and hang disgustingly over the piano. The two texts were composed the night before the event on the first floor of the museum. The night-watchmen, late museum employees - everybody helped.\r\nOn the day of destruction, the temperature rose above freezing for the first time. It was slushy, and the St. Patrick's Day parade was braving the rain on Fifth Avenue. When I arrived in the morning, the museum workmen, usually accustomed to hanging delicate paintings, were struggling to get the machine out of the dome and down to the Sculpture Garden. It was slippery, and things broke. The Addressograph was damaged, and Jean became tense. At one moment I thought he was going to quit it all. But nothing could break his resources of energy, and toward the afternoon his excitement transmitted itself to everyone. The workmen were now breaking their back to get things in order. The museum had given him cart blanche, and everything Jean wanted he got. The rain stopped.\r\nRobert Rauschenberg, who had promised a mascot for the machine, showed up with an object called a money-thrower. When some powder in an open box was lighted, the thrust would release two springs in which he had stuck a dozen silver dollars. Rauschenberg waited for hours to have his money-thrower connected.\r\nEarlier in the morning, I had finally got hold of various stinking liquids, which I put in the bottles. Jean had already rejected the use of nitrogen butyl mercaptan, or the stink of a skunk, in spite of the fact that he had demanded the strongest stenches I could find. I had also found out how to make a thick white smoke. Since several other methods had failed us, I did not emphasize to Jean what I had found, but simply asked him if I could put it in the bassinet. He said O.K.\r\nThe Klaxon did not work. Robert Breer went for a wild last- minute chase for a 6-volt Klaxon and found one that he actually tore off an old car. No new one would do. By then he was so wet and dirty that no taxi would take him back to the museum.\r\nThe public arrived, but nobody noticed it. Jean was fixing the meta-matics. putting on the smoke flashes, and directing everybody else. Not until 6 o'clock did I get a power line to the machine. All the circuits were connected. By accident, Robert Breer turned on the fire extinguisher in the piano. The secret had been revealed, but nobody understood what had happened. I discovered that one leg on the first structure was not sawed through. I was a real irony that the last thing we did was to saw this leg off. If it had been left, the structure would presumably not have collapsed and fallen over.", "sourcemark": "157-159", "source": 1, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [2], "places": [], "title": "HTNY_2003_Kluver_Garden Party_performance", "text": "The public arrived, but nobody noticed it.

If it had been left, the structure would presumably not have collapsed and fallen over.\r\nAt 7:30 I was finished. \" On va?\" \"On va,\" said Jean. He looked as calm as if he were about to take a bus. Not once did we go over and check everything. The construction and the beginning of the destruction were indistinguishable. Bob Breer put the titanium tetrachloride in the bassinet, a friend who had helped me with the circuits put in the plug, and I set the relays. The machine was off. It was launched as it was constructed. Jean was in complete charge [p.160] of his work. The piano was to begin playing slowly as the flame on the keyboard was lighted. But the step-up transformer had broken in transport, so the motor had to be started directly at full speed. The result was that the driving sling jumped the wheel on the piano as the motor started. I went cold. No piano! Nervously, I tried to put on the sling. \"Laisse-moi faire, Billy,\" I heard .Jean's voice say calmly. A fuse had blown. It was fixed. The piano was working again, but only three notes were playing - three sad notes. Some slings had been lost. I saw nothing but the machine. The audience was invisible.\r\nAfter three minutes, the first meta-matic went on. But Jean had reversed the sling so the paper was rolling up instead of down. It was a bizarre effect. Earlier he had with great care put the paper in order and fixed the arm. The audience must have expected a lot from this machine. To make the situation more incredible, the motor driving the arm had not been reconnected. Thus, even if Jean had put the sling on correctly, the meta-matic would not have worked, and the empty paper would have rolled down the trough. Jean was laughing as he always did when something exciting happened. Meta-matic No. 21 produced a three-foot-long painting as the beer cans emptied on to the paper rolling in the wrong direction. And the arm he had worked on to perfection did not function. But the fan at the bottom of the structure was not without use. The smoke was coming out thick and white from the bassinet, and the fan blew it toward the audience. Ladies with mink coats who were sitting in the cafeteria could not see because of the smoke. The percussion elements were working fine.\r\nIn the sixth minute, the radio went on. Nobody could hear it because of the noise. The gasoline bucket was turned over the flame and the piano started burning. Rauschenberg' s money-thrower went off in a big flash. The silver dollars were never seen again. The fan motor started to beat on the drum from the washing machine. But the bottles did not fall. Jean had put in too weak a string. Why? After all our haggle over the stinks! But the only thing that annoyed Jean was that the balloon did not burst. The compressed air bottle was empty. The little two-wheeled cart in front of the meta-matic started to move back and forth.\r\nIn the tenth minute, the second meta-matic started and worked beautifully. It made a black painting streak with the sponge on its arm. The horizontal text went on. Something was wrong with it. It was winding up too slowly. Jean came by: \" Do vou remember the little ring you picked up and asked what it was for? It was to hold the paper roll up.\" Meanwhile, the vertical text was finished and the end of the paper was flying over the burning piano.\r\nJean was walking around calmly. He stopped in front of the machine and let the photographers take pictures, posing like an actor. As he was standing there the text \"Yinq is Yang\" appeared on the horizontal text roll. On the photographs of him with his self- destroying machine in the background, this sentence can be read above his head.\r\nIn the eighteenth minute, the fire extinguisher in the piano was supposed to go off. It didn't. The simple reason was that the piano was no burning all the way through, and the rubber hose had burnt up clogged the extinguisher. But the suicide carriage rolled off some ten feet. The motor was so weak that Jean had to help it along. It would never have made it to the pool anyway, and Jean knew this all along. But he never exchanged the weak motor for a stronger one, which would have been a simple operation. As a functional object, the suicide carriage was supposed to move; as a work of art, it wasn't. This was typical of Jean's relation to the motor. On other places in the machine, there were big motors that did practically nothing; and in one place, he used a motor as a counter weight! The motor was Jean part of sculpture.\r\nThe Addressograph machine began to work. The yellow smoke signal was lighted and the arms banged on the empty oil cans. The bell had never been put into operation. It turned out to be a gong that strikes only once. The whole machine was somewhat sick after [p.161] the bad handling in transport, and it fell over after only a few minutes. In the twentieth minute, the resistors in the first structure were connected. After a few minutes the metal had melted, and the whole structure sagged, but it never collapsed completely and fell over. The reason was that the crossbars that held up the wheels were strong enough to keep the structure together. But the smoke flashes were lighted by the heat of the resistors. In the twenty-third minute, the little carriage shot out from under the piano with terrific speed. Its Klaxon was working fine, and it ended up in a ladder on which the Paris-Match correspondent was standing. He turned it around, and it continued into the NBC sound equipment. Smoke and flames were coming out of its end.\r\nThe fire in the piano was rapidly spreading. At one point, Jean had tried to damp it with an extinguisher. Now the flames had eaten their way through the piano, and Jean suddenly became afraid that the extinguisher on the back of the piano might explode from the heat. He told me to get the fireman to put out the fire.\r\nThe fireman had been there all afternoon. When the fire on the piano started, I was standing next to him. He did not react, and maybe he was enjoying the spectacle. He later called up the fire department. My wife overheard him trying to explain what was going on: \"You see, Joe, there is this fire .... \" It was evidently decided that the fire in the piano was not a fire. Jean called him a \"the\u0301oriticien de feu.\"\r\nWhen I realized what Jean was saying, I tried to explain the situation to the fireman. He did not understand me when I talked about an extinguisher in the piano. The first fire extinguisher from the museum arrived. The fireman was very calm, as if nothing were happening. After three minutes, the longest in my life, they finally began to put out the fire. Even then the fireman was reluctant to do so because of the electrical wiring. At this point, both Jean and I were almost desperate but the audience apparently got the wrong impression of what was happening. They thought the fireman was the one who wanted to put out the fire, and that we were trying to prevent him. They almost lynched the poor man who brought the extinguisher. A giant misunderstanding had developed, in which only the fireman seemed untouched by the confusion. He told me later that, of course, fire extinguishers are not made so that they blow up from heat. There had been no danger whatsoever. The fireman liked the show, he said.\r\nThe fire was damped and Bob Breer courageously knocked the supporting pieces of wood from under the piano. Jean had not dared to use the automatic system because of the bad effects from the transport. The piano collapsed backward but did not fall over.\r\nI separated the fire extinguisher from the piano, and the public descended on the remains for souvenirs. They walked away with the radio, the saw, the meta-matic drawings, and lots of other things. Later the structure was dragged down into a pile of scrap that looked incredible. The bottles broke, so that the garden stank for two days. The junk was carried back to the dump the next day. Only a few mementos survived. The battered Addressograph machine was given to a photographer from the museum, who hauled it away at great expense. It will stand and rust in his garden. The suicide carriage was given to the museum, Bob Breer got a funny wheel construction that had early been put out of operation by the eager audience, and the small carriage with the big motor and the Klaxon stands under my table. All the rest was memory and pictures.", "sourcemark": "159-161", "source": 1, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [4], "places": [], "title": "HTNY_2003_Kluver_Garden Party_comment", "text": "In the same way as a scientific experiment can never fail, this experiment in art could never tai! The machine was not a functional object and was never treated like one. The spectacle can therefore not be judged in terms of whether this or that thing did not work. During the construction of the machine, I was constantly amazed at Jean' s disregard for the simplest rules of engineering. In one instant he would demand that something should function, and in the next he would violate his demand by the most trivial of actions. Jean worked as an artist. He chose his motors and put on his slings as an artist. He was interested only in functional operations that he could understand, so that he could reject or accept them as he pleased. [p.162] But he was also inspired by possibilities of engineering and realized he could use them as long as he was in complete control of what he was doing. As an engineer, working with him, I was part of the machine. This new availability was largely responsible for the size and complexity of the machine.\r\nJean' s machine was conceived out of \" total anarchy and freedom,\" as he put it. The free and chaotic circumstances under which it was built were a necessity and, in a way, a tremendous luxury. Jean supplied the energy to create the freedom and was ruler over the chaos. When the energy was released, everything that happened was related to some of Jean's decisions. No distinction can be made between the\" random\" elements, the accidents, or the controlled parts of the spectacle. It was created in its totality out of freedom and innocence. The bottles that did not fall, the paper roll that rotated in the wrong direction, the fireman and the audience were all part of the same spectacle. There could exist no paradox, no question, no  \"nonsense,\" no a priority, and no chaos in this spectacle. It was a definite demonstration, made with love and humor, and not a philosophical problem.\r\nI do not interpret the self-destruction of Jean's machine as an act of protest against the machine, or an expression of nihilism and despair, as some critics have suggested. The self-destruction or self-elimination of the machine is an ideal of good machines and human beings, this is an obvious truth. This idea has already been expressed by Claude Shannon in the\" Little Black Box,\" in which, when you pull a switch, a lid opens and a hand emerges that throws the switch in the off position whereupon the lid closes again over the hand.\r\nJust as in every moment we see and experience a new and changing world, Jean's machine created and destroyed itself as a representation of a moment in our lives. The art of the museum is related to a past time that we cannot see and feel again. The artist has already left his canvas behind. This art then becomes part of our inherited language, and thus has a relation to our world different than the reality of the immediate now. L'art e\u0301phe\u0301me\u0300re, on the other hand, creates a direct connection between the creative act of the artist and the receptive act of the audience, between the construction and the destruction. It forces us out of the inherited image and into contact with ever-changing reality. In one of Jean's \"manifestes.\" he says that we shall \"be static with movement.\" We must be the creative masters of changing reality - which we are, by the definition of Man. The parts from which Jean's machine were built came from the chaos of the dump and were returned to the dump.\r\nJean kept saying that he was constantly thinking about New York as his machine took form. There are probably many connections, the most obvious one being a machine that has rejected itself and become humor and poetry. New York has humor and poetry, in spite of the presence of the machine, whereas in a purely technocratic society the machine must always be a functional object. Failures of the machine can therefore never be allowed, because control is the necessary element of that society. It is when the machine must function at any cost that there can be no \"Homage to New York.\"", "sourcemark": "161-162", "source": 1, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [5], "places": [], "title": "HTNY_2003_Kluver_Garden Party_preservation", "text": "I separated the fire extinguisher from the piano, and the public descended on the remains for souvenirs.

He asked me if it was possible to make an interactive environment where the temperature, sound, smell, lights, etc., could be affected by the person who moved through it.\r\nOver the next year or two, my colleagues and I tried to work out Rauschenberg's idea for an interactive or, better, reactive environment, but it proved very difficult to achieve what he wanted. We would only work on it in our \"free\" time, which really meant that we took the time for it whenever we chose. Bell Laboratories, like any good research laboratory, left us alone to carry on our own experimental or theoretical research. During this time, I brought Rauschenberg to Bell Labs to see what my colleagues and I were working on.\r\nBy 1962, after many discussions with Rauschenberg, the idea of the work boiled down to a sound environment in which the sounds would come from five AM radios, and the audience could vary the volume and scan rate of each radio from a control unit. Originally, Rauschenberg had anticipated placing the five radios behind five large panels and housing the controls in a stand in front of them. We referred to the piece as an orchestra with the viewer as the conductor. Or as Rauschenberg remarked, \"The intent was to make a musical instrument that could be performed on, with or without sophistication.(7)\r\nRauschenberg did not want wires between the control unit and the radios. He insisted on using the AM band; in those days, FM was the outlet for cultural and classical-music programming. In addition, Rauschenberg wanted the visitor to be able to vary the speed of the scanning from station to station but not be able to stay at or tune in to any given station. Harold Hodges came up with a solution: the tuning dial was turned by a small, variable-speed, DC motor, and the visitor controlled the speed of the motor.\r\nAfter a lot of experimentation, Harold and I began work on a design in which the speakers on the AM radios would be removed, and the output from each radio would be re-transmitted by small AM transmitters to receivers, amplifiers, and speakers mounted behind each panel. At least two complete versions were built and rejected, because of interference between the control signals from the homemade AM transmitters and the AM radio signals, which generated a nightmare of noise.\r\nAll this had taken us a few more years, and what I remember most was working in my small apartment in Murray Hill and standing in endless lines in the electronics shops. By the time we felt that we could finish the system, by the end of 1964, Rauschenberg had long since turned the five panels into the painting Ace (1962; see fig. 90) and had begun to think of our project as a five-piece sculpture.\r\nIn the summer of 1964, the technology caught up with us. We found one of the first crystal-controlled, fully transistorized, wireless microphone systems. Then we were able to put all the AM radio controls for the volume and scanning speed in one of the sculpture pieces and retransmit the sound of the AM radios over the FM band, with a minimum of interference, to FM receivers, amplifiers, and speakers in each of the other sculpture pieces. From the control unit in one of the pieces, the visitors would be able to vary the sound level and the sweep rate of the five radios' station scanners, each associated with sounds in one of the sculpture pieces. For the FM transmitters and receivers, we used a Comdex wireless microphone system, and the radios were GE transistor radio receivers.(8)\r\nMany choices in projects like this one are not made purely on the basis of engineering considerations but are aesthetic choices. Rauschenberg chose the size and shape of the control knobs, the size of the speakers, and where to place the technical components in each piece. When I could no longer make \"midnight requisitions\" of the large gray-blue Bell Laboratories telephone batteries we had been using for the radios, I went to the store and bought the only substitute I could find: bright-red RCA batteries. I brought them to Rauschenberg's loft expecting that he would find the color terrible, but, of course, he immediately fell in love with it. And the red batteries were the only bright color in the piece, until they were discontinued by the manufacturer.(9)\r\n", "sourcemark": "312-313", "source": 3, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 67, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [10], "places": [], "title": "Oracle_2003_Kl\u00fcver on Design & Production", "text": "During the time I was working with Tinguely on Homage to New York, Robert Rauschenberg asked me to collaborate on what he described as an interactive environment.

Rauschenberg wanted no wires from the control unit to the other pieces, so that they could ail be moved freely in relation to one another.\r\nWith the limited technology available in the early 1960's, we designed and built a system where ail the AM radios were located in the control unit and the sound was re-transmitted on the FM band to receivers and speakers in the other pieces.

I mean how did that very different adventure come about? Well, I suppose it wasn't so different from some of the objects you'd made before.\r\nRR: Oracle was I had started it I guess two and a half years ago, maybe even longer than that, closer to three. And it was going to be a radio painting but a concert variation. I did Broadcast, a painting that has three radios in it but only two tuning knobs, one for volume and one for tuning. And I objected to the fact that one had to be standing so close to the picture that the sound didn't seem to be using the space and the way the images were reacting to each other. And that was all right. That was one aspect of it. But through that, having made that and feeling that limitation with that piece, I wanted to do something that was remote control, that could be separated in the room. I had some canvases stretched, but it took so long I needed help with the radios. And it took so long for me to find the help that I used the paintings for something else. Then later I decided that was a good idea because once I started seeing what was involved I saw that with the weight problem, and the depth the painting would have to be to house the equipment, that painting was the wrong form for that to take. So I started on a sculpture. Then I went to Amsterdam to work at the Stadtlijk Museum with what was going to be a collaboration of about five artists, or six. And because I was working in sculpture, I had three weeks; we found that our ideas were so different that it was very difficult to get together and just make a piece.\r\n[...] So I was working with the sculpture which became Oracle with the radios. And painting didn't really interest me. So in a kind of crash program of three weeks I made four pieces of sculpture and some of them quite large. One of them is about ten or twelve feet high and was very densely massed, about eight feet by five feet, and twelve feet high. That was by far the largest work. But I'm not really a sculptor in any traditional sense. I tend to work with materials that are a little heavier and put them together as practically as I can. By being a sculptor, I mean I don't weld or solder.\r\n[...]\r\nDS: Has it continued to interest you since then? I mean, are you likely to resume?\r\nRR: I think the radio piece probably is the closest thing to what I'm about to do next as one can predict without knowing where one's going, because I like very much that mixture of technology and aesthetics.\r\nDS: I was interested in what you said last time we talked, I think, about the sound having been important in shifting the focus of the audience, in a sense, in that insuring a certain movement through the exhibition ...\r\nRR: Literally.\r\nDS: Literally, yes.\r\nRR: You had a sense of distance that as often as not was distorted. You had the feeling possibly of knowing where you were but where you were was lost.\r\nDS: That's very expressive. And another thing that you had mentioned which we haven't recorded was your feeling that it was important that the sound frequencies, that the radio sources, be actual ones, not taped; and your feeling that if you had been able to tape them, it would have been rather like commercial art in that not being an actual ...\r\nRR: Yes.\r\nDS: Would you like to enlarge on that in any way?\r\nRR: No, I think that just about says it. I like for the sound to be as fresh as the daily fall of the dust and rust and dirt that accumulates, which doesn't mean that one doesn't clean it off from time to time. But then that's another thing. It's an actuality of a literal insistence on the piece's operating and existing in the time situation that it's observed in. It's another one of those things trying to put off the death of the work.\r\nDS: Yes. Did I hear you mention before that you had in mind possibly using at some time in the future a piece in which the wind might work as an actual force?\r\nRR: Yes.

It is a work of art which sums up much in his work to date and also points forward and gives a clue of what will come. When you work so closely with an artist for such a long time and have the opportunity to get discouraged many times and then become greatly surprised over the results, you appreciate [feel] more than ever the specific and the glorious way in which the artist sees. \r\n[...]\r\nThe difficulties that arose during the work with Oracle were maybe not so much of a technical nature (the minute we had decided on the solution the technical problems were normal), as in the collaboration with Rauschenberg.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean that Rauschenberg in any way is difficult to work with; he is in reality of wonder of patience.\u00a0 It is simply difficult for an engineer to have a conversation with an artist.\u00a0 The engineer speaks slowly and with a natural hesitation.\u00a0 He knows that the problem can be solved even if he can\u2019t solve it at that moment.\u00a0 He is worried about costs and needs time to experiment and to find out which materials are available.\u00a0 He tries to press the artist for a more detailed description.\u00a0 What is the goal ?\u00a0 How strong should the amplifiers be ?\u00a0 What noise level is permissible ?\u00a0 Can interference between the local oscillators in the radio receivers be permitted?\u00a0 What was the maximum and minimum sweep speed ?\u00a0 Should it be possible for a visitor to stop at a certain station ?\u00a0 How many hours should the batteries last ?\u00a0 The artist works, on his side, fast and with his hands.\u00a0 He works with facts and does not bind himself to theoretical details which concern the future.\u00a0 In a month, in a year, maybe his attitude will be completely different from today.\u00a0 He does not know the engineer\u2019s language, he does not know the meaning of the words.\u00a0 Can the engineer be trusted ? And the engineer needs complete information in order to solve the problem.\u00a0 The artist wants as much freedom as is possible over the result. It is not a question of a collaboration, but rather a contractual relationship between the artist and the engineer so that in the end the engineer is only part of the total work of the artist.\u00a0 The artist has to accept the engineer as he is.\u00a0 \r\nDuring our work with Oracle, several of these questions came up.\u00a0We never arrived at any rational way of working, but I understood that we had to work, apart from the costs, with such a margin that Rauschenberg had as much freedom as possible as we worked towards the final solution.\u00a0 In this way the high sound level was not present in the original specifications for the system.\u00a0We did give Rauschenberg the means to change the sound level, which he wanted to keep high, something we had not foreseen but that he used.\u00a0On the other hand, every amplifier was attached to a speaker of good quality.\u00a0 These Rauschenberg replaced with smaller speakers of worse quality.\r\nOracle needed a high sound level but a relatively bad sound quality (in order to give the impression that you listened to somebody else\u2019s radio.)\u00a0 Other amusing questions appeared repeatedly:\u00a0 What was a technical decision, and what was an \u201caesthetic\u201d decision.\u00a0 The color of the batteries, the size of the controls, the placement of the technical components were all aesthetic decisions.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy for an engineer to get trapped in what he\u2019s doing and make decisions on the basis of what is \u201cbeautiful\u201d instead of what is technically necessary.\u00a0The engineer cannot see what he does as art.\u00a0 In regards to aesthetic questions, working with Rauschenberg became very intimate.\u00a0 \r\nWe\u2019ve learned that the painting is an object among other objects in a room.\u00a0 Jasper Johns shows the back side of a painting.\u00a0 During a piece by John Cage we are forced to accept all sounds as an equal part of the composition.\u00a0Claus Oldenburg let the people whom he uses in his happenings play themselves (in most cases the actors are not conscious of this fact.)\u00a0Oldenburg writes roles in his happenings for a certain person.\u00a0 In such a way the individuals\u2019 shyness, nervousness, and sexuality become part of the happening.\u00a0 \r\nTradition can therefore not tell us anything else but that the technical material in Oracle is an integral part of the sculpture just like the car door, the basin or the window frame.\u00a0 It is impossible to treat the sound as part of the work of art and not the radios themselves. But what is the engineer\u2019s relationship to the artist?\u00a0 He uses his creativity and his experience to create something at the direction of the artist, which he obviously could not make by himself.\u00a0 In the same way that Oldenburg works with and accepts the peculiarities of his actors, the artist has to accept the engineer.\u00a0 The artist is a means for the engineer to arrive at a result, and the artist is equally bound to him as Michelangelo was to his marble.\u00a0Oracle points to the fact that a new type of relationship is possible between the artist and the engineer, and perhaps even between the artist and the scientist.\u00a0 A relationship where the artist tries to use the enormous richness of technology and science to achieve his goal.\u00a0 The goal of the artist may be equally as technically complicated as building a huge accelerator or launching of\u00a0 a satellite, but his goals should lie within as yet undiscovered areas of art and science:\u00a0 to create new wonders, new sensual experiences, new pressures, new ways to experience each other, new ways to experience light, dark, coldness, heat; new ways to sleep, to be, and to eat.\u00a0 Every engineer is conscious today of the fact that no exaggerations can describe the capacity of technology, but at the same time, the inventiveness of the engineers, how technology can be used, limited by his laziness, one-sidedness, and psychological attitude.\u00a0 The relation of the engineer to the use of technology in art can today be compared to the people who insist that the only goal of art is to create a beautiful object full of a higher order.\u00a0 The engineer cannot believe that the technology can be used to create disorder, but the artist can.\u00a0 The artist, and only the artist, can show the engineer how technology can be used at its full capacity.\u00a0 The technical part of Oracle is senseless from any engineering point of view possible.\u00a0 From the radios all tuned to the AM four radio programs are re-transmitted to four other transceivers--in the same room.\u00a0 The engineer can only shake his head when he hears that such a project cost almost 50,000 crowns.", "sourcemark": "?", "source": 5, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 73, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [132, 121, 145, 120, 141, 144, 146, 130, 127, 131, 118, 137, 138, 139, 126, 123, 116, 135, 147, 124, 148, 136, 149, 125, 140, 143, 133, 119, 134, 122, 142, 53], "places": [], "title": "Lecture series_1968_On the schedule and list of lecturers (1)", "text": "EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INCORPORATED 9 East l6th Street, New York 10003\r\n\r\nThe following series of demonstrations - bullsessions - lectures by scientists and engineers is designed for artists.

The Sculpture was to be shown at the grand opening of the Centre Pompidou in 1977, and Hodges and I got involved again. Twelve years of wear and tear on the system and further advances in technology made it clear that the piece should be redesigned for its new location. We also saw a chance to get rid of the last remaining problems of noise and interference. With the redesign, we were now able to move the AM radios and the DC motors out of the control console and into each piece, eliminating the need to retransmit the control signals from the console. We installed what was called a \"digital proportional remote radio control system\" designed for remote-controlled hobby airplanes. Digital control signals for volume and sweep rate were transmitted in the 70 MHz band to servomotors in the other four pieces. Oracle had now entered the space age.\r\nI went to Paris to install Oracle and found that Beaubourg was not a friendly place for it. The steel structure of the building acted as a Faraday cage, shielding the interior from the relatively long electromagnetic waves of the AM frequency band, so that only static could be heard on Oracle's radios. To overcome this problem, I had to install a master receiving antenna on the roof. (The only access to the roof was a thirty foot ladder from the sixth floor outside walk-way and I found myself all alone on the roof stringing the wire for the large antenna.) To get the AM signal to the gallery where Oracle was shown, I used a Jerrold Broadcast Band Amplifier, which was designed for radio showrooms and promised \"you can turn on your AM radios and demonstrate the static-free humfree reception that generate sales.\" Hardly space-age technology, but the best I could do. What made the situation worse was that there were only 3 AM radio stations in Paris and a few audible stations from the rest of France. I had hoped to be able to tune the system to receive other European stations, but lack of time and help made this impossible in time for the opening.\r\nRauschenberg arrived and we worked frenetically to get Oracle going. An hour before the official opening, we plugged in the pump motor for the shower and blew all the fuses in our section of the museum. The electricians had gone home for the day and no one knew where to find the fuse box. When Minister of Culture Michel Guy and the director Pontus Hulten brought President Giscard d'Estaing and Princess Grace by, we were standing in semi-darkness. The sound from a few lonely radio stations could be heard from Oracle, and with the refrigeration coils inoperative, the frozen fat was slowly melting in Joseph Beuys' piece nearby.", "sourcemark": "67-67", "source": 9, "actors": [], "authors": [170]}}, {"pk": 78, "model": "archive.annotation", "fields": {"activities": [], "phases": [100], "places": [], "title": "Oracle_1997_Kl\u00fcver on the restoration (1979-1981)", "text": "I was able to plan a re-design of the system for Oracle in 1979.
